Competition Checklist / Best Practices



	• RoboRio power
		• Ensure 10 & 20 amp mini blade fuses are damage free and firmly inserted into PDP at their appropriate location.
		• Ensure you have spare unused 10 amp fuses: This protects the RoboRio.

		• Ensure you have spare unused 20 amp fuses: This protects the VRM and possibly PCM if it's connected to the same section.

		• Ensure power cables are firmly inserted and locked in to the PDP and Rio power connector. Use of ferrules / ferrels is highly recommended.

		• Ensure power cables have NO copper showing on either end when they are inserted into the respective devices, PDP and Rio.
		• Exposed copper wire / strands have a higher risk of shorting out and / or breaking.
		• Ensure you have extra RoboRio power connectors

	• Radio power - It's highly advised to do both Option 1 & 2, they will not interfere with each other and provide redundancy.
		• Option #1: Use POE injector to power radio.
			• Either cut power cord portion of POE and insert that into the VRM or connect a barrel jack to the POE injector and use heat shrink to securely fasten barrel connectors together.
			• NOTE: Out of an abundance of caution, it's advised you use the KoP PoE injector only for powering the Radio. Connect an ethernet cable directly from the Radio to the RoboRio. If you need to use both ports on the radio, ensure that the Rio uses the direct connection and the other device is connected to the PoE injector.
		• Option #2: Ensure barrel connector is firmly seated into power socket on radio.
			• Use 3d printed radio holder with barrel jack fitting to secure barrel connector.
			• Use nylon zip ties to secure barrel connector. Take care to not crush the radio with the zip ties as this may lead to internal short circuits occurring.
			
	• Robot Power
		• Ensure battery connector is firmly attached.
		• Use nylon zip tie to secure both connectors together.
		• Ensure battery holder is capable of securely holding battery in event of full speed stoppage. eg; going full speed into a wall or another robot.
		• Ensure main breaker is clear of any moving items that may trigger the “off” button on top.
		• If main breaker has tripped multiple times, it may be more susceptible to tripping at a lower amperage or failing altogether. This really depends on a wide variety of circumstances, but if it appears to be tripping often and there’s no obvious cause, replace it and test.
		• Have a backup main breaker available.
		• Test it before competition.
		• Impact, continuity, off button, etc…
		• Ensure battery crimps are properly and solidly crimped. If desired, solder them. Crimping Power Lugs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0aNc8M0MY8
		• Ensure battery wires and wires going into the PDP are not bent at high angles directly after the crimp.
		• This will break strands in the wire leading to possible shorts, lower operational voltage and higher resistance which can lead to wires heating up and failure.
		
	• Driver Station
		• Always charge your computer, both in the pit and on the field.
		• Ensure there is no password on the computer, or ensure that all students know the password.
		• Turn off Windows Updates while at competitions.
		• Turn off Windows Defender Firewall on private networks while at competitions.
		• Turn off IPv6 on Ethernet, Wifi and USB - ethernet network adapters.
		• Turn on IPv4 DHCP aka Obtain IP Address automatically.
		• Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on the driver station while at competitions.
		• It is recommended to have a computer dedicated solely to being the driver station. This means no programming or surfing the web with this computer.
		• If the computer must be used for other activities, close all applications except the driver station software when going out to a match.
		• Move or remove old DS Log files, default path: c:\Users\Public\Documents\FRC\DS Logs, suggestion is to move to another folder for archiving.

	• RoboRio
		• Turn on IPv4 DHCP / dynamic / automatic addressing for the Ethernet interface on the RoboRio web interface.

	• On-board co-processors
		• Turn on IPv4 DHCP / dynamic / automatic addressing for their respective Ethernet interfaces.
		
	• Firmware / Software Versions
		• Ensure you are up to date with the firmware during development and definitely prior to inspection.
			• Software
				• Driver Station
				• WPILib
			• Firmware
				• RoboRio Image
				• Talon SRX
				• PCM
				• PDP
		• Use CSA file repo or resource reference for lists of current software / firmware.
			• CSA file repo: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2HKW3Zk3KIRLUhpWWxWRUszbHc
			• CSA file resource list: https://github.com/firstmncsa/csa_resources/blob/master/csa_file_reference.pdf

	• Inspection readiness
		• Go through inspection checklist prior to bag day
		• Attach bag and tag form to robot bag via clear plastic sleeve
		• Put a copy of CAW on driver station for quick access
		• Prepare any spare parts necessary for quick installation (bag with robot if possible to avoid withholding allowance)

	• Mechanical
		• Ensure all motors with have leads attached
		• Identify if any mechanism is exposed to potential impact and determine if it needs to be protected.

	• Misc. 
		• Generate pre match check-list, assign action to specific individuals. Run through it several times before bag up. Test checklist at Week 0 event.
