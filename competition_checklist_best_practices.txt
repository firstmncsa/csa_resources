Competition Checklist / Best Practices



	• RoboRio power
		• Ensure 10 amp fuse is damage free and firmly inserted into PDP at the appropriate location.
		• Ensure you have spare unused 10 amp fuses.
		• Ensure power cables are firmly inserted and locked in to the PDP and Rio power connector. Use of ferrules / ferrels is highly recommended.
		• Example: https://www.amazon.com/Crimping-Ernovo-Terminal-Connection-Connectors/dp/B075ZNL5MD/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1511289210&sr=8-2&keywords=ferrels
		• Ensure power cables have NO copper showing on either end when they are inserted into the respective devices, PDP and Rio.
		• Exposed copper wire / strands have a higher risk of shorting out and / or breaking.
		• Ensure you have extra RoboRio power connectors

	• Radio power
		• Option #1: Use POE injector to power radio.
			• Either cut power cord portion of POE and insert that into the VRM or connect a barrel jack to the POE injector and use heat shrink to securely fasten barrel connectors together.
		• Option #2: Ensure barrel connector is firmly seated into power socket on radio.
			• Use 3d printed radio holder with barrel jack fitting to secure barrel connector.
			• Use nylon zip ties to secure barrel connector. Take care to not crush the radio with the zip ties as this may lead to internal short circuits occuring.
			
	• Robot Power
		• Ensure battery connector is firmly attached.
		• Use nylon zip tie to secure both connectors together.
		• Ensure battery holder is capable of securely holding battery in event of full speed stoppage. eg; going full speed into a wall or another robot.
		• Ensure main breaker is clear of any moving items that may trigger the “off” button on top.
		• If main breaker has tripped multiple times, it may be more susceptible to tripping at a lower amperage or failing altogether. This really depends on a wide variety of circumstances, but if it appears to be tripping often and there’s no obvious cause, replace it and test.
		• Have a backup main breaker available.
		• Test it before competition.
		• Impact, continuity, off button, etc…
		• Ensure battery crimps are properly and solidly crimped. If desired, solder them. Crimping Power Lugs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0aNc8M0MY8
		• Ensure battery wires and wires going into the PDP are not bent at high angles directly after the crimp.
		• This will break strands in the wire leading to possible shorts, lower operational voltage and higher resistance which can lead to wires heating up and failure.
		
	• Driver Station
		• Always charge your computer, both in the pit and on the field.
		• Ensure there is no password on the computer, or ensure that all students know the password.
		• Turn off Windows Updates while at competitions.
		• Turn off Windows Defender Firewall on private networks while at competitions.
		• Turn off IPv6 on Ethernet, Wifi and USB - ethernet network adapters.
		• Turn on IPv4 DHCP aka Obtain IP Address automatically.
		• Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on the driver station while at competitions.
		• It is recommended to have a computer dedicated solely to being the driver station. This means no programming or surfing the web with this computer.
		• If the computer must be used for other activities, close all applications except the driver station software when going out to a match.

	• RoboRio
		• Turn on IPv4 DHCP / dynamic / automatic addressing for the Ethernet interface on the RoboRio web interface.

	• On-board co-processors
		• Turn on IPv4 DHCP / dynamic / automatic addressing for their respective Ethernet interfaces.
		
	• Firmware / Software Versions
		• Ensure you are up to date with the firmware during development and definitely prior to inspection.
			• Software
				• Driver Station
				• WPILib
			• Firmware
				• RoboRio Image
				• Talon SRX
				• PCM
				• PDP
		• Use CSA file repo or resource reference for lists of current software / firmware.
			• CSA file repo: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2HKW3Zk3KIRLUhpWWxWRUszbHc
			• CSA file resource list: https://github.com/firstmncsa/csa_resources/blob/master/csa_file_reference.pdf

	• Inspection readiness
		• Go through inspection checklist prior to bag day
		• Attach bag and tag form to robot bag via clear plastic sleeve
		• Put a copy of CAW on driver station for quick access
		• Prepare any spare parts necessary for quick installation (bag with robot if possible to avoid withholding allowance)

	• Mechanical
		• Ensure all motors with have leads attached
		• Identify if any mechanism is exposed to potential impact and determine if it needs to be protected.

	• Misc. 
		• Generate pre match check-list, assign action to specific individuals. Run through it several times before bag up. Test checklist at Week 0 event.
