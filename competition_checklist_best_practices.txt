Competition Checklist / Best Practices



	• RoboRio power
		• Ensure 10 amp fuse is damage free and firmly inserted into PDP at the appropriate location.
		• Ensure you have spare unused 10 amp fuses.
		• Ensure power cables are firmly inserted and locked in to the PDP and Rio power connector. Use of ferrules / ferrels is highly recommended.
		• Example: https://www.amazon.com/Crimping-Ernovo-Terminal-Connection-Connectors/dp/B075ZNL5MD/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1511289210&sr=8-2&keywords=ferrels
		• Ensure power cables have NO copper showing on either end when they are inserted into the respective devices, PDP and Rio.
		• Exposed copper wire / strands have a higher risk of shorting out and / or breaking.
	• Radio power
		• Option #1: Ensure barrel connector is firmly seated into power socket on radio.
			• Use 3d printed radio holder with barrel jack fitting to secure barrel connector.
			• Use nylon zip ties to secure barrel connector.
		• Option #2: Use POE injector to power radio.
			• Either cut power cord portion of POE and insert that into the VRM or connect a barrel jack to the POE injector and use heat shrink to securely fasten barrel connectors together.
	• Robot Power
		• Ensure battery connector is firmly attached.
		• Use nylon zip tie to secure both connectors together.
		• Ensure battery holder is capable of securely holding battery in event of full speed stoppage. eg; going full speed into a wall or another robot.
		• Ensure main breaker is clear of any moving items that may trigger the “off” button on top.
		• If main breaker has tripped multiple times, it may be more susceptible to tripping at a lower amperage or failing altogether. This really depends on a wide variety of circumstances, but if it appears to be tripping often and there’s no obvious cause, replace it and test.
		• Have a backup main breaker available.
		• Test it before competition.
		• Impact, continuity, off button, etc…
		• Ensure battery crimps are solidly crimped.
		• Ensure battery wires and wires going into the PDP are not bent at high angles directly after the crimp.
		• This will break strands in the wire leading to possible shorts, lower operational voltage and higher resistance which can lead to wires heating up and failure.
	• Driver Station
		• Always charge your computer, both in the pit and on the field.
		• Ensure there is no password on the computer, or ensure that all students know the password.
		• Turn off Windows Updates while at competitions.
		• Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on the driver station while at competitions.
		• It is recommended to have a computer dedicated solely to being the driver station. This means no programming or surfing the web with this computer.
		• If the computer must be used for other activities, close all applications except the driver station software when going out to a match.
