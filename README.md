Welcome! This repository is intended to contain everything a CSA might need to be prepped for an event, minus physical items of course, there is a list of those items in the goodie bag document though. We are constantly building the software list, updating all the resources and documenting useful items, if you find something useful that's not listed here, please let us know. Also please feel free to make suggestions, send PRs, ask questions, etc.... Thanks!

CSA File Reference - Contains a list of files useful for CSA work, along with version info, OS, URL, directory in Google Drive file repo and notes. -- For any licensed software, please follow the URL listed and accept the end user license.

CSA Note - This is a note specifically for contacting a CSA on and off season for help. For MN regional events, a note with specific information for that event will be handed. Those notes will be uploaded as regional events occur. For any teams that want help for a non-regional event or general help, please use the info in csa_note_XXXX.pdf.

CSA Goodie Bag - This is a list of hardware, cables, tools, etc... that a CSA might need for an event.

All of these lists, documents and files are in a constant state of change. Please clone this repo and update it often with a pull. We recommend cloning this repo to your CSA flash drive and then updating it there as often as possible. We recommend you copy the contents of the google drive down to your CSA flash drive just prior to an event as well. We will try to stay as update to date with the sources of the files as possible.

Thanks and looking forward to another great year in FRC!
First MN CSA team
