PLEASE READ: New for 2019, switching over to the CSA USB tool at the link below. The files in this repository will be updated for event support materials and perhaps some misc items used by CSA's in the the upper midwest. The FirstMNCSA google drive will no longer be updated for DS / Programming tools, please use the USB tool below for that.

Welcome! This repository is intended to contain everything a CSA might need to be prepped for an event, minus physical items of course, there is a list of those items in the goodie bag document though. We are constantly building the software list, updating all the resources and documenting useful items, if you find something useful that's not listed here, please let us know. Also please feel free to make suggestions, send PRs, ask questions, etc.... Thanks!

CSA files link below contains all the files, installers, drivers, etc... you will need to update, flash and program you FRC robot control system.

Document descriptions

Reference Materials / CSA File Reference - Contains a list of files useful for CSA work, along with version info, OS, URL, directory in Google Drive file repo and notes. -- For any licensed software, please follow the URL listed and accept the end user license.

Event Materials / CSA Note - This is a note specifically for contacting a CSA on and off season for help. For MN regional events, a note with specific information for that event will be handed. Those notes will be uploaded as regional events occur. For any teams that want help for a non-regional event or general help, please use the info in csa_note_XXXX.pdf.

Event Materials / CSA Goodie Bag - This is a list of hardware, cables, tools, etc... that a CSA might need for an event.

All of these lists, documents and files are in a constant state of change. Please clone this repo and update it often with a pull. We recommend cloning this repo to your CSA flash drive and then updating it there as often as possible. We recommend you copy the contents of the google drive down to your CSA flash drive just prior to an event as well. We will try to stay as up to date with the sources of the files as possible.

Thanks and looking forward to another great year in FRC!
First MN CSA team
